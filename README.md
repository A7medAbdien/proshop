# ProShop (E-Commerce Store)

ProShop is a comprehensive online store that allows users to manage products, users, and orders as an admin, as well as browse and make purchases using PayPal as a payment method.

## About the Development

ProShop was developed using the MERN Stack, which stands for MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js. This powerful combination of technologies enables us to build a robust and scalable web application. Visual Studio Code was utilized as the Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for coding and development tasks.

In addition, Postman was utilized as a tool to test and validate API calls. Postman provides a user-friendly interface that allows developers to send HTTP requests and receive responses, making it easier to debug and troubleshoot the application's backend functionality.

By leveraging the MERN Stack and Postman, we were able to create a feature-rich and reliable e-commerce platform that delivers an exceptional user experience.

## Project Setup Instructions

To set up and run the ProShop project on your local machine, please follow the steps below:

1. Clone the project repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/your-repo-link) to your local machine.
2. Install the necessary dependencies by running the command `npm install` in the project root directory.

4. Start the development server by running the command `npm run dev` in the project root directory.
5. Access the ProShop application by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:3000`.

Please note that some additional configuration steps may be required depending on your specific development environment and setup.

# Post

Thrilled to share a classic project, [ProShop](https://github.com/A7medAbdien/proshop) - an E-Commerce website developed using the MERN stack. Postman was utilized for testing and seamlessly integrating payment options. Although PayPal integration was effortless, it is unavailable in my region. However, Checkout and Tap are excellent alternatives worth exploring.
