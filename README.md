# Similarity With .Net Web Assembly

## .Net

1. Model
2. Service (interface - class) - (server logic)
3. Program.cs (addScoped)
4. Controller (for each service) - (endpoint)
5. fetch on Client

## Express

1. Model
2. Routes (Works as controllers in .Net we try to keep them thin as possible)
3. server.js (app.use) - (Here it just route to the file, but in it define its scope)
4. Controller (server logic - works as services in .Net)
5. fetch on Client
